# EDM_Repo
This repo is for EDM final project

The dataset is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ioJ29mhFNqRtkxy_OH3cZvod6q-XUDek/view?usp=sharing, download the data and put it at the root folder of this repo (i.e., just next to ipynb files).

The final project has three models, the first_model.ipynb is the first model...

For the second model, firstly run second_model_preprocess.ipynb to generate seuqnetial patterns, then go to https://github.com/uma-pi1/mgfsm to mine frequent patterns, then run second_model.ipynb

Same for the third model.

Some process need manually change the parameter names, like the index of the assignment...

quizzes.py is a basic script to extract quizzes information from db, no need to call it individially, it is included and used in ipynb files.
